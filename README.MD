# Third Person Shooter

This repository contains source code for Third Person Shooter Game with Unreal Engine 5.
I plan to build a playable level. And eventually, a complete game.  

Assets, and other content has not been added to this repository due to licensing terms.  

Once this is playable, I shall ad Steam/Epic Game store links here.
